This is a collection of some very useful Unix command-line tools, rewritten in Rust and compiled so you can use them in Windows!

**How To Use**

There are 2 ways to use these tools. 

1. You can download the exes from the releases tabs, put them into a directory (e.g., C: Scripts), and add that directory to your path. Now, you can use the tools anywhere on your system.

2. You can download the source files and use cargo to compile the rust files into executables that you can use.

**Note:**

These files were compiled on a 64-bit version of Windows 11, so if you do not share these specifications, I cannot guarantee the tools will work.

I am working to compile these for other versions, but for now, this is all I have. Sorry for any inconvenience this could cause.
